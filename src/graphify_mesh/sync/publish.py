"""Versioned generation publish + atomic `current` symlink flip (WS1 item 8).

Publish never deletes a previous generation. If validation fails or the
stale-repo threshold is exceeded, the caller simply never calls `publish()`
— "rollback" is defined as `current` never having been moved, which is why
this module never touches `current` except in the final atomic rename.

than whatever `current` presently points at, past the automatic cases
above), see `bin/graphify_mesh.sync/ROLLBACK.md`.
